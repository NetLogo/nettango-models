      "info": "This model is inspired by the aggregation behavior of slime-mold cells.\n\nThe slime mold spends much of its life as thousands of distinct single-celled units, each moving separately. Under the right conditions, those many cells will coalesce into a single, larger organism. When the environment is less hospitable, the slime mold acts as a single organism; when the weather turns cooler and the mold enjoys a large food supply, \"it\" becomes a \"they.\" The slime mold oscillates between being a single creature and a swarm.\n\nThis model shows how creatures can aggregate into clusters without the control of a \"leader\" or \"pacemaker\" cell. This finding was first described by Evelyn Fox Keller and Lee Segel in a paper in 1970.\n\nBefore Keller began her investigations, the conventional belief had been that slime mold swarms formed at the command of \"pacemaker\" cells that ordered the other cells to begin aggregating. In 1962, Shafer showed how the pacemakers could use cyclic AMP as a signal of sorts to rally the troops; the slime mold generals would release the compounds at the appropriate moments, triggering waves of cyclic AMP that washed through the entire community, as each isolated cell relayed the signal to its neighbors. Slime mold aggregation, in effect, was a giant game of Telephone \u2014 but only a few elite cells placed the original call.\n\nFor the twenty years that followed the publication of Shafer's original essay, mycologists assumed that the missing pacemaker cells were a sign of insufficient data, or poorly designed experiments. But Keller and Segel took another, more radical approach. They shows that Shafer had it wrong --  that the community of slime mold cells were organizing themselves without any need for pacemakers. This was one of the first examples of emergence and self-organization in biology.\n\nInitially, biologists did not accept this explanation. Indeed, the pacemaker hypothesis would continue as the reigning model for another decade. Now, slime mold aggregation is  recognized as a classic case study in bottom-up self-organizing behavior.\n\nIn this model, each turtle drops a chemical pheromone (shown in green). The turtles also \"sniff\" ahead, trying to follow the gradient of other turtles' chemicals. Meanwhile, the patches diffuse and evaporate the pheromone. Following these simple, decentralized rules, the turtles aggregate into clusters."

The seeded watermelon has the ability to mutate and therefore has biodiversity. While the fungus may kill some of the seeded watermelons, the biodiversity will give them a much greater chance of surviving the fungus. The watermelon that survives the population will reproduce and since they reproduce they are likely (but not guaranteed) to have the mutation that allows them to survive the fungus. As the seeded watermelon continues to reproduce, the watermelon with the mutation to survive the fungus will survive but its offspring without the mutation will die."
