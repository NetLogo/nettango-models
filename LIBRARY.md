## Antomology

### [Antomology - Ant Colony](https://netlogoweb.org/nettango-player?playMode=true&netTangoModel=https://netlogoweb.org/assets/nt-modelslib/Antomology/Antomology%20-%20Ant%20Colony.ntjson) [(editable)](https://netlogoweb.org/nettango-builder?netTangoModel=https://netlogoweb.org/assets/nt-modelslib/Antomology/Antomology%20-%20Ant%20Colony.ntjson)

In this game, two colonies of ants forage for food. Though each ant follows a set of simple rules, the colonies as a whole act in sophisticated ways. Ant Adaptation simulates two ant colonies side by side, each controlled by a different player.

The model teaches users about complexity through play. The sensing area of the view contains five widgets for each of the two players. With Ant Adaptation, we aim to realize the promise of agent-based modeling originally illustrated by systems such as GasLab (Wilensky, 1997) or NIELS (Sengupta and Wilensky, 2009), in a rich interaction form factor for walk-up-and-play use in an informal learning space.

### [Slime Tutorial](https://netlogoweb.org/nettango-player?playMode=true&netTangoModel=https://netlogoweb.org/assets/nt-modelslib/Biology/Slime%20Tutorial.ntjson) [(editable)](https://netlogoweb.org/nettango-builder?netTangoModel=https://netlogoweb.org/assets/nt-modelslib/Biology/Slime%20Tutorial.ntjson)

This model is inspired by the aggregation behavior of slime-mold cells.

The slime mold spends much of its life as thousands of distinct single-celled units, each moving separately. Under the right conditions, those many cells will coalesce into a single, larger organism. When the environment is less hospitable, the slime mold acts as a single organism; when the weather turns cooler and the mold enjoys a large food supply, "it" becomes a "they." The slime mold oscillates between being a single creature and a swarm.

This model shows how creatures can aggregate into clusters without the control of a "leader" or "pacemaker" cell. This finding was first described by Evelyn Fox Keller and Lee Segel in a paper in 1970.

Before Keller began her investigations, the conventional belief had been that slime mold swarms formed at the command of "pacemaker" cells that ordered the other cells to begin aggregating. In 1962, Shafer showed how the pacemakers could use cyclic AMP as a signal of sorts to rally the troops; the slime mold generals would release the compounds at the appropriate moments, triggering waves of cyclic AMP that washed through the entire community, as each isolated cell relayed the signal to its neighbors. Slime mold aggregation, in effect, was a giant game of Telephone — but only a few elite cells placed the original call.

For the twenty years that followed the publication of Shafer's original essay, mycologists assumed that the missing pacemaker cells were a sign of insufficient data, or poorly designed experiments. But Keller and Segel took another, more radical approach. They shows that Shafer had it wrong --  that the community of slime mold cells were organizing themselves without any need for pacemakers. This was one of the first examples of emergence and self-organization in biology.

Initially, biologists did not accept this explanation. Indeed, the pacemaker hypothesis would continue as the reigning model for another decade. Now, slime mold aggregation is  recognized as a classic case study in bottom-up self-organizing behavior.

In this model, each turtle drops a chemical pheromone (shown in green). The turtles also "sniff" ahead, trying to follow the gradient of other turtles' chemicals. Meanwhile, the patches diffuse and evaporate the pheromone. Following these simple, decentralized rules, the turtles aggregate into clusters.

This model explores the stability of predator-prey ecosystems. Such a system is called unstable if it tends to result in extinction for one or more species involved.  In contrast, a system is stable if it tends to maintain itself over time, despite fluctuations in population sizes.

### [Ideal Gas Law](https://netlogoweb.org/nettango-player?playMode=true&netTangoModel=https://netlogoweb.org/assets/nt-modelslib/Chemistry%20and%20Physics/Ideal%20Gas%20Law.ntjson) [(editable)](https://netlogoweb.org/nettango-builder?netTangoModel=https://netlogoweb.org/assets/nt-modelslib/Chemistry%20and%20Physics/Ideal%20Gas%20Law.ntjson)

This model enables students to draw a model to "sketch" up representations of new systems to explore concepts related to gas behavior and gas particles. A wide range of real world systems can be modeled with this simple interface (e.g. diffusion of perfume from an uncapped container, hot gas mixed with a cold gas, mixtures of gases).

This model is part of the Particulate Nature of Matter (PNoM) Curricular Unit. Most of the models in PNoM use the same basic rules for simulating the behavior of gases.  Each model highlights different features of how gas behavior is related to gas particle behavior and adds to new features to the model.

In all of the models, gas particles are assumed to move and to collide, both with each other and with objects such as walls.

In this model, particles can be added, color coded, and sped up or slowed down, by drawing with the mouse cursor in the WORLD & VIEW.  Also, additional types of removable and replaceable walls can be added to the WORLD.

## Theory Building

### [Diffusion Graphics](https://netlogoweb.org/nettango-player?playMode=true&netTangoModel=https://netlogoweb.org/assets/nt-modelslib/Theory%20Building/Diffusion%20Graphics.ntjson) [(editable)](https://netlogoweb.org/nettango-builder?netTangoModel=https://netlogoweb.org/assets/nt-modelslib/Theory%20Building/Diffusion%20Graphics.ntjson)

Diffusion Graphics is unlike most other NetLogo models, in that it really doesn't 'model' anything. It simply explores the power behind an interesting patch primitive: 'diffuse'.

It's not intended to closely model real heat, just a number that behaves something like heat -- that slowly spreads itself evenly across a plane.

### [Disease](https://netlogoweb.org/nettango-player?playMode=true&netTangoModel=https://netlogoweb.org/assets/nt-modelslib/Theory%20Building/Disease.ntjson) [(editable)](https://netlogoweb.org/nettango-builder?netTangoModel=https://netlogoweb.org/assets/nt-modelslib/Theory%20Building/Disease.ntjson)

This project simulates the spread of a fire through a forest.  It shows that the fire's chance of reaching the right edge of the forest depends critically on the density of trees. This is an example of a common feature of complex systems, the presence of a non-linear threshold or critical parameter. This model extends the Fire Simple model by adding fire fighting ability.

### [Salt Lake City Earthquakes](https://netlogoweb.org/nettango-player?playMode=true&netTangoModel=https://netlogoweb.org/assets/nt-modelslib/Theory%20Building/Salt%20Lake%20City%20Earthquakes.ntjson) [(editable)](https://netlogoweb.org/nettango-builder?netTangoModel=https://netlogoweb.org/assets/nt-modelslib/Theory%20Building/Salt%20Lake%20City%20Earthquakes.ntjson)

Even though earthquakes can’t be predicted we do have an idea of where they occur and how to measure them using a seismograph. Students investigate a phenomenon that exemplifies the pattern. In the model the blue capital building collapses when it's structural integrity reaches zero due to earthquakes.

A speaker plays sound at different volumes. The greater the movement of the speaker the louder the sound and the greater the amplitude of the particle movement.

### [Thermal Equilibration](https://netlogoweb.org/nettango-player?playMode=true&netTangoModel=https://netlogoweb.org/assets/nt-modelslib/Theory%20Building/Thermal%20Equilibration.ntjson) [(editable)](https://netlogoweb.org/nettango-builder?netTangoModel=https://netlogoweb.org/assets/nt-modelslib/Theory%20Building/Thermal%20Equilibration.ntjson)

### [Watermelon Biodiversity](https://netlogoweb.org/nettango-player?playMode=true&netTangoModel=https://netlogoweb.org/assets/nt-modelslib/Theory%20Building/Watermelon%20Biodiversity.ntjson) [(editable)](https://netlogoweb.org/nettango-builder?netTangoModel=https://netlogoweb.org/assets/nt-modelslib/Theory%20Building/Watermelon%20Biodiversity.ntjson)

Students investigate seedless watermelon (artificial asexual reproduction via grafting) and seeded watermelon (naturally reproducing sexually) to see how they are affected when a fungus is introduced into the population. What can be done to help the watermelons survive the fungus?

Video about how seeded fruit is made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewtlsEb4Vgk&feature=youtu.be

Since the seedless watermelon is grafted and reproduced asexually there is little to no biodiversity which means that a fungus could wipe out the entire population. The seeded watermelon has the ability to mutate and therefore has biodiversity. While the fungus may kill some of the seeded watermelons, the biodiversity will give them a much greater chance of surviving the fungus. The watermelon that survives the population will reproduce and since they reproduce they are likely (but not guaranteed) to have the mutation that allows them to survive the fungus. As the seeded watermelon continues to reproduce, the watermelon with the mutation to survive the fungus will survive but its offspring without the mutation will die.
