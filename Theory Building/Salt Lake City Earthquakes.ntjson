As such, it impacts the lower frequency \n;;  seismic waves, and can have more widespread effects and influence larger structures that tend to be more sensitive \n;;  to low-frequency motions. Deep sedimentary basins can have a large effect on ground motion above them. Earthquake \n;;  waves traveling at high velocity through the stiff, crystalline rock of the crust refract and slow dramatically \n;;  when entering the basin. This increases the amplitude of the earthquake waves, and the sharp density contrast \n;;  of the soft basin rocks with surrounding material can cause waves to reflect, trapping energy in the basin for\n;;  a period of time. This extends the duration of shaking.

Students investigate a phenomenon that exemplifies the pattern. In the model the blue capital building collapses when it's structural integrity reaches zero due to earthquakes.\n\n\n## HOW IT WORKS\nA wave of enegery starts aat one of the six fault lines on the map. The waver agents pass that energy to each other. This creates a wave that progagates outwards. When the wave hits the blue capital building it damges the building. When the wave hits the yellow seismograph building it moves the seismograph inside.\n\n\n## HOW TO USE IT\nPress \"setup\" and then \"go\". Then press one of the earthquake buttons such as \"West Valley Fault Quake\". To stop the quake press \"Stop all Earthquakes\" \n\n\n## THINGS TO TRY\nTry changing stiffness, friction, quake amplitute, or quake frequency.\n\n## EXTENDING THE MODEL\n\n\n\n## NETLOGO FEATURES\n\n\n## CREDITS AND REFERENCES\n\nThis model builds of the Wave Machine Model (Wilensky, 1997).\n\n\n\n## HOW TO CITE\n\nIf you mention this model or the NetLogo software in a publication, we ask that you include the citations below.\n\nFor the model itself:\n\n* Kit Martin.
