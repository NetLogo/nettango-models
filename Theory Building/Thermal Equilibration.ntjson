We do this because when the\n  ; student introduces new particles from the side, we want them to\n  ; form a uniform wavefront.\n  ;\n  ; Why do we want a uniform wavefront?  Because it is actually more\n  ; realistic.  (And also because the curriculum uses the uniform\n  ; wavefront to help teach the relationship between particles collisions,\n  ; wall hits, and pressure.)\n  ;\n  ; Why is it realistic to assume a uniform wavefront?  Because in reality,\n  ; whether a collision takes place would depend on the actual headings\n  ; of the particles, not merely on their proximity.  Since the particles\n  ; in the wavefront have identical speeds and near-identical headings,\n  ; in reality they would not collide.  So even though the two-particles\n  ; rule is not itself realistic, it produces a realistic result.  Also,\n  ; unless the number of particles is extremely large, it is very rare\n  ; for three or  particles to land on the same patch (for example,\n  ; with 400 particles it happens less than 1% of the time).  So imposing\n  ; this additional rule should have only a negligible effect on the\n  ; aggregate behavior of the system.\n  ;\n  ; Why does this rule produce a uniform wavefront?  The particles all\n  ; start out on the same patch, which means that without the only-two\n  ; rule, they would all start colliding with each other immediately,\n  ; resulting in much random variation of speeds and headings.  With\n  ; the only-two rule, they are prevented from colliding with each other\n  ; until they have spread out a lot.  (And in fact, if you observe\n  ; the wavefront closely, you will see that it is not completely smooth,\n  ; because  collisions eventually do start occurring when it thins out while fanning.)\n  ; the following conditions are imposed on collision candidates:\n    ;   1. they must have a lower who number than my own, because collision\n    ;      code is asymmetrical: it must always happen from the point of view\n    ;      of just one particles.\n    ;   2. they must not be the same particles that we last collided with on\n    ;      this patch, so that we have a chance to leave the patch after we've\n    ;      collided with someone.\n    ;; we also only collide if one of us has non-zero speed.

This model is part of the \"Connected Chemistry\" curriculum http://ccl.northwestern.edu/curriculum/ConnectedChemistry/ which explores the behavior of gases.\n\nMost of the models in the Connected Chemistry curriculum use the same basic rules for simulating the behavior of gases.  Each model highlights different features of how gas behavior is related to gas particle behavior.\n\nIn all of the models, gas particles are assumed to move and to collide, both with each other and with objects such as walls.\n\nIn this model, particles can be added, color coded, and sped up or slowed down, by drawing with the mouse cursor in the WORLD & VIEW.  Also, additional types of removable and replaceable walls can be added to the WORLD.\n\nThis model enables students to draw a model of a real world system and then test that model.  A wide range of real world systems can be modeled with this simple interface (e.g. diffusion of perfume from an uncapped container, hot gas mixed with a cold gas, mixtures of gases).\n\n## HOW IT WORKS\n\nThe particles are modeled as hard balls with no internal energy except that which is due to their motion.  Collisions between particles are elastic.  Collisions with the wall are not.\n\nThe exact way two particles collide is as follows:\n1. A particle moves in a straight line without changing its speed, unless it collides with another particle or bounces off the wall.\n2. Two particles \"collide\" if they find themselves on the same patch. In this model, two turtles are aimed so that they will collide at the origin.\n3. An angle of collision for the particles is chosen, as if they were two solid balls that hit, and this angle describes the direction of the line connecting their centers.\n4. The particles exchange momentum and energy only along this line, conforming to the conservation of momentum and energy for elastic collisions.\n5. Each particle is assigned its new speed, heading and energy.\n\nAs the walls of the box are heated, the sides of the walls will change color from a deep red (cool) to a bright red, to pink to a pale pink white (hot).  The walls contain a constant heat value throughout the simulation.\n\nThe exact way particles gain energy from the walls of the box is as follows:\n1. Particles check their state of energy (kinetic).\n2. They hit or bounce off the wall.\n3. They find wall energy and set their new energy to be the average of their old kinetic energy and the wall energy.\n4. They change their speed and direction after the wall hit.\n\n## HOW TO USE IT\n\nButtons:\nSETUP - sets up the initial conditions set on the sliders.\nGO/STOP - runs and stops the model.\nMOUSE INTERACTION - when this is set to \"none - let the particles interact\" the particles will move and interact with each other and the surroundings.  When set to any other value you can then click in the WORLD & VIEW to paint, erase, color, or add various objects and properties.\n\nSliders:\nINITIAL-#-PARTICLES - sets the number of gas particles in the box when the simulation starts.\nINITIAL-GAS-TEMPERATURE sets the initial temperature of the gas.\n\nSwitches:\nSHOW-WALL-HITS? turn visualization of when particles hits the walls (as flashes) on or off\n\nChoosers:\nVISUALIZE-SPEED? allows you to visualize particle speeds.  For example, selecting \"arrows\", creates a representation of each particle velocity using a scalar arrow.  Selecting \"shades\" creates representation of each particle speed using a brighter (faster) or darker (slower) shade of the particle's color.\n\nMOUSE-INTERACTION  sets the type interaction the user can do with the mouse in the WORLD & VIEW.  Possible settings include:\n\"none - let the particles interact\" - particles move about\n\"draw basic wall\" - adds a gray wall under the mouse cursor\n\"draw red removable wall\" - adds a red wall under the mouse cursor which can be alternatively removed and replaced (like a valve) using the REMOVE/REPLACE RED WALL.\n\"draw green removable wall\" - adds a green wall under the mouse cursor which can be alternatively removed and replaced (like a valve) using the REMOVE/REPLACE GREEN WALL.\n\"big eraser\" - erases all objects (except the yellow box boundary walls) under the mouse cursor.\n\"slow down particles\" - increase the current speed of the particles by 10%.\n\"speed up particles\" - reduces the current speed of the particles by 10%.\n\"paint particles green\" - recolors the particles under the mouse cursor green (other settings include orange and purple)\n\"add green particles\" - adds a couple of new particles under the mouse cursor (other settings include orange and purple)\n\nPlots:\n- 1: TEMPERATURE OF GASES VS. TIME: plots the temperature of the different gases in the model, as indicated by their color (orange particles, green particles, and purple particles)\n\n## THINGS TO NOTICE\n\nThe mouse interaction can be used while the model is running as well as when it is stopped.\n\n## THINGS TO TRY\n\nCreate a model of how odors move throughout a room.  Why do some people smell the odor before others?  Does the layout of furniture, large objects, and walls in the room effect the movement of the odor?  How about the temperature of the air in the room?\n\nCreate a model of diffusion of a perfume from a closed container.  How would you represent the different gases (the perfume and the surrounding air)?  What shape will the container be?  How will you model a removable cap or lid?\n\nCreate a model of room filled with cold air and a different room filled with warm air.  How will represent these different rooms of air?  What could you add to show what happens when they mix?\n\nCreate a model of heat transfer that shows what happens to the energy of one very fast moving gas particle when it hits a bunch of very slow moving gas particles.  What does this show happening to the energy of the initial gas particles?\n\n## RELATED MODELS\n\nSee GasLab Models\nSee other Connected Chemistry models.\n\n## CREDITS AND REFERENCES\n\nThis model is part of the Connected Chemistry curriculum.
